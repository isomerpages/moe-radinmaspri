<p>Our Radin Mas Story mural depicted the growth and progress of Radin Mas Primary School from our humble beginnings as an all-boys school in 1926 to our current standing as a choice school which prides herself in allowing her students to play hard, work hard and make a mark.</p>
<p>This mural guides our students to remember the past, appreciate the present and create the future. It also aims to inspire our students both past and present to write their own story as they journeyed through the gates of Radin Mas Primary to grow as confident person, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens.</p>
