My entry into the world had shaped my values, which continued to guide me in my career and life journey. Every day I count my blessings having been born prematurely because of an accident.

The various roadblocks during my life journey have developed resilience and courage in me as I marked the different milestones in my journey.

<em><strong>~ I believe life is a process of continuous change and a constant struggle to make that change one for the better ~</strong></em>

The quote from our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew resonates with me. Building on the efficient and sound systems and processes that RMPS has established over the years, my "struggle" is to enhance the systems and processes together with staff and stakeholders, to better support our students in their learning; and to develop each child holistically, equipping him with competencies for the future.

<em>Everyone can rise above their circumstances and achieve success if they are dedicated to and passionate about what they do ~</em> Mother Teresa
