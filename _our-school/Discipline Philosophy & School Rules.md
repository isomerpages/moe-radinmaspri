<p><strong>Attendance and Punctuality<br /></strong>Attendance in school is compulsory. Absence from school must be covered by a medical certificate or a letter from parent/guardian that should be submitted to the form teacher within three working days.</p>
<p>Students who do not submit their medical certificate or letter from their parent/guardian will be considered as being &ldquo;absent from school without valid reason&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Students are expected to attend all lessons, CCA training, school events and functions as required. They should report punctually for all activities and lessons. They should not be absent without a valid reason.</p>
<p>Students are expected to assemble by 7.40 am every day for flag-raising. The school will contact parents of latecomers to seek their support to ensure that their child reports to school punctually.</p>
<p>Parents may also be required to meet the school staff to discuss their child&rsquo;s late-coming issue if the tardiness persists and work with the school on ways to help their child come to school on time. Parents/guardians will be asked to meet the form teacher, level discipline teacher, level coordinators, HOD Discipline or School Leaders depending on the severity of the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Disciplinary Action Against Inappropriate Behaviour<br /></strong>The school provides opportunities to reward students for appropriate behaviour and for improvement in academic and non-academic work. The use of rewards in school is based on the principle of positive reinforcement; behaviour that is rewarded is strengthened and is therefore likely repeated. However, the school does not condone acts of misdeeds committed by students. The school will mete out consequences accordingly.</p>
