<p>My entry into the world had shaped my values, which continued to guide me in my career and life journey. Every day I count my blessings having been born prematurely because of an accident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The various roadblocks during my life journey have developed resilience and courage in me as I marked the different milestones in my journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>~ I believe life is a process of continuous change and a constant struggle to make that change one for the better ~</strong></em></p>

<p>The quote from our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew resonates with me. Building on the efficient and sound systems and processes that RMPS has established over the years, my &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; is to enhance the systems and processes together with staff and stakeholders, to better support our students in their learning; and to develop each child holistically, equipping him with competencies for the future.</p>
