<p>2022 was a good year for Radin Mas Primary. We have done well as a school on multiple domains. Our P6 cohort showcased resilience and determination and performed well as a cohort. In the areas of teaching and learning, the experiences of Covid left an indelible mark for all. The use of technology is now brought to the forefront of classroom teaching. Beyond this, as a school, we are committed to shape our students to be future ready learners and thus relooked at the learning experiences in school and made very deliberate attempts to make learning more authentic, segmented, connected, and reflective to engender in all our students an intrinsic motivation to learn and to imbue a growth mindset in all.</p>
<p>2022 was also a wonderful year of achievements for our staff. Two of our projects, our Maths department&rsquo;s Money Sense Programme as well our Year Heads&rsquo; S.H.I.N.E or student well-being efforts were awarded the commendation award at the annual MOE Innergy Awards. It is a platform where the ministry celebrates and affirms innovation in schools which brings about positive impact either in teaching and learning or student well-being. Our very own, Mrs Cindy Cheng, was also accorded the LEAP award for 2022.&nbsp;The LEAP Award, which stands for &ldquo;Listening Educator for Advancement and Progress Award&rdquo;, was launched by the late former President S R Nathan in 2011 to recognise exceptional teachers who have made a positive impact in nurturing their students from the heart.</p>
<p>2023 will also be an equally exciting and meaningful year for Radin Mas Primary School. We will continue to identify, shape, and develop talents in multiple domains and anchor in all our students strong character grounding, grit and optimism. We remain committed to support and stretch individual learners and to provide a positive learning environment for all our students to flourish. We are confident that the Radin Mas Experiences will continue to allow all our students to make a mark in their own ways.<br /><br />Thus, let us continue to work together in 2023 to shape resilience, positivity and growth. Let me urge all our students to look at 2023 with fresh lenses and to continue to challenge themselves to be the best version of themselves. Challenge is the only path to growth!</p>
<p>Have a meaningful 2023 ahead!</p>
