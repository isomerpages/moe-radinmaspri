Welcome to Radin Mas Primary School website.

Let me start by wishing all a wonderful 2024 ahead. May the year ahead be paved with positivity, opportunities for growth and self-discovery.

2023 was another meaningful and significant year for Radin Mas Primary school. In 2023, Radin Mas Primary continued to push quality holistic education for all our students. In line with our vision to allow all our students to work hard, play hard and make a mark, it has been another busy year as we balance the demands of academics with engaging and meaningful programmes which aim to shape not only character growth and development but also to imbibe and imbue key 21st CC competencies in all our students in the areas of critical and inventive thinking, communication and collaboration, and also civic literacy, global awareness and cross cultural skills.

As a school, we curated multiple platforms to allow our students to make a mark through various domains. We are very proud of the achievements of our students as they pushed themselves and stepped out of their comfort zones to represent the school in academic competitions and exposure, National School Games, various arts and aesthetics platform and also in values inculcation and enactment.&nbsp; Making a Mark in Radin Mas Primary is never about placements, trophies or medals but more so in how they challenge themselves and demonstrate key values such as grit, teamwork and resilience in the process. This is where true learning resides.

I am optimistic and confident that 2024 will be equally another meaningful year for Radin Mas Primary School. We will continue to identify, shape and develop talents in multiple domains and anchor in all our students strong character grounding and grit. We remain committed to support and stretch individual learners and to provide a positive learning environment for all our students to flourish. We are confident that the Radin Mas Experiences will continue to allow all our students to make a mark in their own ways and are very excited by the boundless opportunities for our students to grow and discover themselves further both as lifelong and future ready learners.

Thus, let us continue to partner each other in 2024 to shape resilience, positivity and growth in all our students. Let me urge all our students to look at 2024 with confidence and optimism and to continue to enjoy their learning experiences as learning is the only constant for growth and there is no limit to this growth.

Wishing all a meaningful 2024 ahead!
