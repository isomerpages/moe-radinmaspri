The rich heritage of Radin Mas Primary School forms the bedrock for quality holistic education.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the humble beginnings of our school in 1926, we have evolved in keeping with times and raised generations of active and contributing citizens.

Education is about nurturing the whole child to be the best person that he can be.&nbsp; To educate a person is to prepare him for life. &nbsp;Education Minister Chan Chun Sing emphasized that given the landscape in our world today, no amount of frontloading will ever be sufficient to prepare our people for life.&nbsp; Instead, the first 15 years must build the foundations upon which learning continues for the next 50 years of life.&nbsp; Our mission here at Radin Mas Primary School is to develop each child holistically and equip him with competencies for the future.&nbsp; The foundations we build enable every child to embrace life-long learning, ride the waves of changes in life confidently and bounce back with resilience in the face of challenges.&nbsp;

The interesting fact about schooling is that it involves teachers of the past generation educating the present generation to raise a future generation!&nbsp; As a community of educators and professionals, we role model life-long learning for our students in the continuous pursuit of the joy of learning and teaching.&nbsp; While we develop new skills and mindsets, we also believe what firmly anchors at the core of education must be a values-driven education, rooted with fundamentals which remain unchanging with times and yet, embraces life-skills to prepare every child to face the ever-changing demands in our evolving landscapes.

Our young will write our future and the future of Singapore.&nbsp; There is an African proverb which goes, “It takes a village to raise a child.”&nbsp;&nbsp; We are privileged to have the strong support of parents, stakeholders and partners-in-education including our School Advisory Committee, Parent Link and the RMPS Alumni to raise our children.&nbsp; Together, we bring out the best in every child who passes through our hands!&nbsp; Together, we realise our vision where all work hard, play hard and make a mark!&nbsp; Together, we build on our rich heritage and co-create the future of Radin Mas Primary School, of our families and our nation!
