The lamp, shuttlecock, manuscript and soccer ball emphasizes a well-balanced education which the school provides, where students work hard and play hard. The lamp represents the school's focus on cultivating and nurturing our unique culture and traditions. The manuscript signals the school's belief in academic rigour and discipline. The shuttlecock and the soccer ball highlight the importance of non-academic domains in ensuring holistic education and to allow our students to make a mark either individually or collectively. The school colours - white, red and black-signify our youthful students working and playing closely together, giving each other the support and will to succeed.
