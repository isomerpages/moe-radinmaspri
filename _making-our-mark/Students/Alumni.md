<td style="width: 72%;"><p>Tuan Haji Othman Wok was born in 1924 and is the most respected former resident of Kampong Radin Mas.</p>
<p>He excelled in many ways, from winning awards as a journalist to becoming a respected assemblyman and Minister. He joined the People's Action Party in 1954 and subsequently became the Minister for Social Affairs. He was also an ambassador to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. After his retirement in 1981, he was author of several best-selling books on horror, mystery and the macabre.</p>
<p><em>"Radin Mas was an English school that admitted only boys. In those days, schools believed in corporal punishment. Being hit by teachers was commonplace and I remember being slapped at least once."</em></p>
<p><em>"Kampong days were happy times for me. Life was carefree. I had many friends, with whom I played catching and marbles in the Radin Mas School padang (field). I would take advantage of every situation to play."</em></p></td>
