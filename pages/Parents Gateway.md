<p>Radin Mas Primary School will be on-boarding Parents Gateway from Semester 2 onwards.</p>
<p>Parents Gateway is a mobile app specially designed for parents by MOE and GovTech. Parent Gateway allows school to communicate with parents on updating them about school&rsquo;s programmes and activities and for parents to provide consent hence easing the administrative paperwork.</p>
<p>Parents are invited to download the Parents Gateway mobile app on their mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms only) and experience the convenience and benefits that Parents Gateway brings.</p>
<p>From July 2019, parents who are on-board Parents Gateway will receive information via the mobile app but hardcopy will still be available at GO for parents who are unable to come on-board Parents Gateway. If you are an existing user of SNAAP, please note that SNAAP will still be in use until September 2019.</p>
