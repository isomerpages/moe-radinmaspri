<p>Students and staff of Radin Mas Primary School expressed their gratitude and respect through words and pictures in notes of appreciation for the unsung heroes in our Singapore Armed Forces. From packing surgical masks late into the night for every Singapore household to screening visitors at checkpoints into the country, thousands of these men and women in the SAF have been toiling steadily for weeks in the fight against a new deadly enemy &ndash; COVID-19. Their efforts, often behind the scenes, have helped Singapore hold its ground.</p>
<p>The staff and students of RMPS presented their notes and cards to LTC Ang Khai Siang, G1, Army 6 Division, who graciously received them yesterday morning in the school.</p>
<p>To all those serving us in this time of need, thank you for all the hard work and Heart work! You are showing us what it truly means to put others before self.</p>
