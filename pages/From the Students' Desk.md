Dear Radin Mas family,

Throughout this entire year, I had encountered many different challenges and obstacles. Nevertheless, every cloud has a silver lining, and I achieved many successes, too.

When I first started my prefect journey in Primary 3, there were a lot of people telling me about their problems and asking for advice. This led me to believe that I had to learn everything just to be prepared for any questions posed to me. However, as I grew older and started looking at the bigger picture, I realised that even a prefect cannot be perfect and there would always be something new to learn every day.

Throughout my primary school journey, I have always been eager to participate in different types of extra-curriculum activities that my parents and teachers sign me up for. In school, I participated in different E2Ks – the hands-on projects imparted skills and knowledge that students in secondary school learn. After school, I also attended coding lessons and badminton lessons. Each class taught me new skills. All these activities have not only equipped me with a versatile skillset, they have also deepened my Desire for Learning – spurring me to seek out new experiences, skills and information that improve my abilities and enjoyment.

As a student leader, I believe that serving my school is extremely important. As a leader, fellow students will look to you, and you will be their role model. Student leaders are not only supposed to be a good leader, but to also be a servant leader. Being a leader means that you understand priorities, listen, and put others before self. For example, during the high elements section in P5 camp, one of my friends was nervous about falling but I encouraged him that he would be fine, and we both made it across the obstacle course.

Looking ahead to 2024, I hope that the Covid-19 pandemic will end once and for all so that everyone in school will have a much better time. For some of us, we may feel nervous, happy or stressed about next year but all I want to say is just enjoy yourself and make some new friends!

I want to thank my parents and all my teachers, schoolmates and friends for guiding me along in this wonderful journey as without them I would not be where I am at today. Let us all Work Hard, Play Hard and Make a Mark!

**Tan Kai Herng, RMPS Head Prefect (2023/2024)**
