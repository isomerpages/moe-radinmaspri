RMPS Senior Rugby boys participated in the 2023 National School Games and emerged **6th** in the final standing of Singapore Schools. In the Classification Stage, the boys played 3 matches and won all 3 against SJI Junior, Gong Shang Primary and North Vista Primary. They were then placed in League Tier 1, playing against Bedok Green, Bukit Timah, ACS (P) and ACS (J). They won the matches against Bedok Green and Bukit Timah but were unfortunately defeated by ACS (P) and ACS (J). In their final match against Sembawang Primary, they fought hard but were unable to turn the game in their favour.

Throughout the entire tournament, the Senior Rugby boys played hard and displayed great teamwork. They showed a lot of perseverance, determination and courage in all their games, living up to RMPS core value of Never Give Up. RMPS is very proud of our Senior Rugby boys and congratulate them on their fine achievement.
