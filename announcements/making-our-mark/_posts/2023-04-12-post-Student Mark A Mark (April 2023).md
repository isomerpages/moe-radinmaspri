The Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP) team (2022-2023) participated in the National Finals hosted by RGS on 31 March 2023. We are pleased to share that they have clinched the 1st position!

The team identified the problem of tap water wastage in the community. They presented on the importance of saving water and how they can ensure sustainable water supply through the use of rainwater collection.

The team showcased their approaches to how rainwater can be collected with the use of existing household items. Through collaboration with the school canteen vendors, OSOs, school staff and some residents in Bukit Purmei, the students gathered feedback on the efficacy of their prototype and water saving solutions. Working on the communityâ€™s feedback, the students have also designed a self-watering plant system using MicroBit where the rainwater collected could be used to water the plants.
