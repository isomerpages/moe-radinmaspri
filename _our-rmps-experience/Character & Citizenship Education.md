<p>NE Commemorations</p>
A big part of CCE lies in the building of skills related to components in the domain of civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills, so that students are able to function effectively as concerned citizens who stay rooted to Singapore. As part of the Citizenry efforts of the school, all students will be active participants in the 4 NE Commemorations – Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. Class-based activities, both online and offline, will be implemented for all commemorations. These include interactive programmes planned for the commemorations, with our P3 - 6 student NE/VIA Ambassadors taking helm of the activities and assembly programmes. We hope that by the end of their 6-year journey with RMPS, students would have had rich experiences in helping them understand the key messages behind each commemoration.</td>

<p>Values Programme</p>
<p>At the heart of CCE lies the core values that we hope to inculcate in our students. We firmly believe that values make up the foundation of character and guide students to discern between right and wrong. The teaching of such values come across strongly in CCE Lessons, which are conducted in the Mother Tongue Languages. At the same time, values education permeates all other subjects and CCAs, as teachers would pick-up on day-to-day happenings to teach values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further strengthen the inculcation of values, the school-based Values Programme, which runs at various platforms, provides students with opportunities to practice the values in real-life situations. The Values Programme comprises the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly assembly&nbsp;</li>
<li>Values In Action tasks</li>
<li>Character Workshops (termly)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Peer Support &amp; Relationship lessons (termly)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Growth Mindset series (termly)</li>
</ul>

<p>Education &amp; Career Guidance</p>
<p>Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) is one of the big pieces in CCE. In primary school, ECG serves to equip students with the knowledge, skills and values needed to make informed decisions about post-primary education. At the same time, we encourage students to discover their passion and interest, and explore different careers, so as to broaden their mindset and showcase the varied possibilities.</p>
<p>In RMPS, though ECG lessons are embedded in the P3 – 6 FTGP curriculum, the school has put in place a variety of activities at all levels to promote an awareness of educational opportunities and career aspirations. The school hopes that ECG can help students to better understand themselves, and further enhance SE competencies. Through these activities, school also puts in platforms for partnership with the parents to encourage greater conversations about ECG topics.</p>
