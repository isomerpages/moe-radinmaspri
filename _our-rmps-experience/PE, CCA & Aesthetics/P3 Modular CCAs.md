<p>In pursuit of a well-rounded education, our P3 students will have the
opportunity to engage in Modular CCAs during Semester 1. The primary objectives
of Modular CCAs are to broaden students' horizons through exposure to domains
such as sports, performing &amp; visual arts, clubs &amp; societies, and
uniformed groups. These sessions also serve as a platform for students
to explore their interests and discover their talents before committing
to a specific CCA for the remainder of their school journey.</p>
<p>Our P3 students are organized into three groups, with approximately 70
students per group. Each group will participate in three consecutive sessions,
rotating through the three Modular CCAs. This rotational approach ensures
that all students have the chance to experience and explore various interests.
All students will complete 9 sessions by the end of their Modular CCA experience.</p>
