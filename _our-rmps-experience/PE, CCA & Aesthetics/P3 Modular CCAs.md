<p>In  pursuit of a well-rounded education, our P3 students will have the opportunity  to engage in Modular CCAs during Semester 1. The primary objectives of Modular  CCAs are to broaden students' horizons through exposure to domains such as  sports, performing &amp; visual arts, clubs &amp; societies, and uniformed  groups. These sessions also serve as a platform for students to explore their  interests and discover their talents before committing to a specific CCA for  the remainder of their school journey.</p>
<p>Our  P3 students are organized into three groups, with approximately 70 students per  group. Each group will participate in three consecutive sessions, rotating  through the three Modular CCAs. This rotational approach ensures that all  students have the chance to experience and explore various interests. All  students will complete 9 sessions by the end of their Modular CCA experience.</p>
