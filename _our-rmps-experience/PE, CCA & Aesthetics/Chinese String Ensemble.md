<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Radin Mas Primary School has always been committed to nurturing musical
talents, and in 2024, we are proud to introduce the Chinese String Ensemble,
an exciting new chapter in our schoolâ€™s musical heritage. This ensemble
provides students with the opportunity to explore the world of Chinese
string instruments while fostering a love for traditional Chinese music.</p>
<p>Building on the legacy of our previous Chinese Orchestra, the Chinese
String Ensemble aims to inspire students with a deeper understanding of
Chinese music and culture. Our members will be trained in both individual
technique and ensemble performance, allowing them to collaborate as they
learn to play beautiful, harmonious music together.</p>
<p>The ensemble will perform at various school events, including the Chinese
New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, and we look forward to offering
more performance opportunities in the future. We are excited to see our
students grow in skill, confidence, and passion for Chinese string music.</p>
<p>We believe the Chinese String Ensemble will offer our students a unique
and fulfilling musical experience, helping to cultivate their creativity
and discipline, while also preserving and sharing the rich heritage of
Chinese music.</p>
