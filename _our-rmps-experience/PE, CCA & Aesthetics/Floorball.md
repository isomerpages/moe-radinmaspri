<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Radin Mas Primary School has proudly offered Floorball as a CCA since
2024, switching from Hockey to Floorball. Over the years, our Hockey and
Floorball CCA members have enjoyed recognition for their skills through
DSA to secondary schools.</p>
<p>In Floorball, we place a strong emphasis on developing not only our students'
skills in the sport but also their confidence and determination to excel.
We instill discipline both on and off the pitch, firmly believing that
the values our students learn on the pitch have a direct impact on their
academic pursuits.</p>
<p>Floorball is a fun, fast-paced and inclusive sport played indoors with
floorball sticks and a ball. The sport is easy to pick up with simple rules
and promotes teamwork, agility, and strategic thinking. It offers our students
a chance to engage in physical activity, develop their hand-eye coordination,
and enhance their cardiovascular fitness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Floorball is a sport that encourages teamwork and fosters
a sense of belonging amongst members. We believe that the skills, camaraderie,
and personal growth opportunities that Floorball provides will be instrumental
in shaping well-rounded individuals who are not only successful in sports
but also in their academic endeavours and beyond.</p>
