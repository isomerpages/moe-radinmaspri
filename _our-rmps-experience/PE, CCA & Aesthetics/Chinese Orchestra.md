<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Chinese Orchestra is one of the niche CCAs in Radin Mas Primary School. It was first set up in 1985 with the aim of nurturing student musicians. The Chinese Orchestra seeks to provide various platforms within and outside school such as Chinese New Year Celebration and Mid-Autumn Festival for our members to gain performing experiences and hone their musicianship in the process.</p>
<p>Since 1990, the Chinese Orchestra has been participating in the biannual Singapore Youth Festival and has always been performing exceptionally well. Such consistency could only be possible through rigour and hardwork, values which are instilled in members of the Chinese Orchestra.</p>
