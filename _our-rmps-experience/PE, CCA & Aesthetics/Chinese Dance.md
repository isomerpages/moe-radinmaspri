<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>At Radin Mas Primary School, Chinese Dance is more than just an art formâ€”it
is a celebration of culture, heritage, and self-expression. Our Chinese
Dance programme offers students the opportunity to engage in an expressive
form of art that combines grace, athleticism, and discipline. Through movement,
storytelling, and music, students immerse themselves in the rich cultural
heritage of Chinese dance, fostering a deeper appreciation for Chinese
arts.</p>
<p>Our goal is to cultivate expertise in Chinese Dance while nurturing a
profound understanding of both traditional and contemporary dance techniques.
By offering a well-rounded dance experience, we aim to help our students
build confidence, teamwork, and resilience.</p>
<p>Each year, we welcome a new group of promising dancers from the Primary
3 cohort, fostering growth and strength within the team. The group regularly
performs at school events such as the Chinese New Year Celebration, Mid-Autumn
Festival Celebration, and Aesthetic Week, as well as community events like
the Mid-Autumn Festival organized by the Resident Committee.</p>
<p>Our dancers also participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts
Presentation for Dance. We are proud to have achieved the <strong>Certificate of Distinction</strong> in
both the SYF 2022 and 2024 Arts Presentation for Dance.</p>
<p>The RMPS Chinese Dance group will continue to set high goals and work
diligently to enhance their skills, performances, and cultural understanding.
Join us as we celebrate the beauty and tradition of Chinese dance!</p>
