<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>RMPS Table Tennis CCA hopes to cultivate a sense of appreciation and passion for table tennis in our students as well as develop their skills in the sport.</p>
<p>Table Tennis is a sport that relies on quick reflexes, agility and strength. Our members are put through a training programme to help them develop these key areas and strengthen their techniques of the game. During CCA time, we also aim to build character rooted in sound moral values like sportsmanship, and instilling a sense of discipline and responsibility in our students.</p>
<p>Every year, our members participate in the South Zone Inter Primary Schools Table Tennis Championships, National Individual Table Tennis Championships and Crocodile Challenge Cup organised by Singapore Table Tennis Association. Through these valuable experiences, our members will be able to gain a better understanding of the sport as well as develop their resilience and mental toughness as they face the challenges and pressure of these competitions.</p>
<p>To prepare for the competitions, selected members will be invited to attend school-team training sessions, in addition to the usual CCA training sessions. Members who have shown outstanding skills and discipline consistently will also be nominated as CCA leaders.</p>
