<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>RMPS Table Tennis CCA fosters an inclusive environment where students
of all abilities can participate, develop their potential, and cultivate
a passion for the sport. We aim to instill an appreciation for table tennis
while helping students improve their reflexes, agility, strength, and techniques.</p>
<p>Through our training program, students not only enhance their technical
skills but also develop important values like teamwork, self-discipline,
and determination.</p>
<p>Those who demonstrate perseverance and commitment will be invited to represent
the school in national competitions, gaining valuable experiences that
build resilience and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Selected members will attend school team training sessions in addition
to regular CCA sessions, offering further opportunities for growth. Members
who show consistent dedication and skill may also be given leadership roles,
such as mentoring or assisting with training, to further develop their
personal growth.</p>
<p>Participating in table tennis nurtures confidence, perseverance, and a
growth mindset, encouraging students to embrace setbacks and continuously
strive for improvement.</p>
