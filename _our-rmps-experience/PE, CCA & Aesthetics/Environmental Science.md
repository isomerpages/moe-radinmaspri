<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Environmental Science CCA at Radin Mas Primary School aims to raise
awareness about environmental issues and cultivate a deep appreciation
for the environment. Through engaging activities such as waste management,
composting, energy conservation, recycling, planting, and biodiversity
conservation, our members actively contribute to a more sustainable school
and community.</p>
<p>As part of the CCA, students are trained to become environmental ambassadors,
taking on leadership roles to guide their peers in school-based environmental
initiatives. This empowers them to inspire and encourage others to take
responsibility for the environment and make a personal commitment to its
protection and preservation.</p>
<p>Through their involvement, students develop a greater sense of environmental
stewardship, leadership skills, and a lifelong commitment to sustainability.</p>
