<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Infocomm Technology Club is a dynamic modular-based CCA that equips
members with valuable skills in Micro:bit coding, game-design, LEGO Education
SPIKE Prime and New Media Program over their 4-year CCA journey. Through
engaging and hands-on activities, the club aims to nurture students to
be passionate, creative and proficient in ICT, while developing essential
21st century competencies.</p>
<p><strong>Micro:bit coding &amp; Game Design</strong>
</p>
<p>These modules reinforce key computational thinking concepts such as decomposition,
abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithm design. Through hands-on
projects, students develop problem-solving skills by applying sequencing,
selection, iteration, and logical reasoning. These activities also enhance
students’ coding proficiency, logical thinking, and creativity in digital
making—laying a strong foundation for more advanced programming in the
future.</p>
<p><strong>LEGO Education SPIKE Prime&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>This module introduces students to the basics of coding and engineering
through LEGO robotics. It serves as a foundation for participation in advanced
competitions like the FIRST LEGO League (FLL). Students gain a solid understanding
of the SPIKE Prime system, including its hardware and programming environment.
The module also cultivates 21st-century competencies such as collaboration,
self-management, social awareness, sportsmanship, and responsible decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>New Media Program</strong>
</p>
<p>This module empowers students with digital content creation skills using
iPads. Through photography, videography, augmented reality, digital drawing,
artificial intelligence, and podcasting, students gain hands-on experience
in various forms of new media. The program emphasizes responsible media
production, digital literacy, and the creation of socially meaningful content,
while fostering students’ creativity and communication skills.</p>
<p>Together, these four modules provide a holistic and enriching experience
that prepares Infocomm Technology Club members to thrive in the digital
age and become confident users and creators of technology.</p>
