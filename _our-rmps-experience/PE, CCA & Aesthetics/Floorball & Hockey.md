<p>Radin  Mas Primary School has proudly offered Hockey as a CCA since 2006. Over the  years, our Hockey CCA has achieved recognition and remarkable success within  the primary school hockey community.</p>
<p>In  Hockey, we have always placed a strong emphasis on developing not only our  students' skills in the sport but also their confidence and determination to  excel. We instill discipline both on and off the pitch, firmly believing that  the values our students learn on the pitch have a direct impact on their  academic pursuits.</p>
<p>As we look forward to the future, we're excited to  announce a transition in our CCA offerings. Starting in 2024, we will introduce  Floorball for our P3, P4 and P5 students. This transition will mark an exciting  new chapter in our CCA journey.</p>
<p>Floorball  is a fun, fast-paced and inclusive sport played indoors with floorball sticks  and a ball. The sport is easy to pick up with simple rules and promotes  teamwork, agility, and strategic thinking. It offers our students a chance to  engage in physical activity, develop their hand-eye coordination, and enhance  their cardiovascular fitness. Additionally, Floorball is accessible to students  of all skill levels, making it an inclusive sport that encourages participation  and fosters a sense of belonging within our school community. We believe that  the skills, camaraderie, and personal growth opportunities that Floorball  provides will be instrumental in shaping well-rounded individuals who are not  only successful in sports but also in their academic endeavours and beyond.</p>
