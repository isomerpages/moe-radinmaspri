<p>Art &amp; Crafts CCA is for students with great interest and love for the Visual Arts. Besides drawing and colouring, our students are exposed to different media and art forms, like sand art, floral art, print making and photography. Students are also involved in enhancing the school&rsquo;s aesthetics environment such as painting of wall murals around the school.</p>
<p>Opportunities are given to students to represent the school in various art competitions organised nationally and internationally. Teachers will guide the students in their preparation and art making. Some of these competitions are the SYF Art Exhibition, International Youth Floral Art Competition, World Kids Colouring Day, Kao International Art Competition and more.</p>
