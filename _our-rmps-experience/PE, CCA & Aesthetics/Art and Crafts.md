<p><strong>O</strong>ur CCA</p>
<p>Art &amp; Crafts CCA at Radin Mas Primary School is a creative space where
imagination meets hands-on creativity. Designed for students passionate
about the Visual Arts, this CCA goes beyond traditional drawing and coloring,
offering exposure to various artistic media and techniques, such as sand
art, floral art, printmaking, and photography.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of our dedicated teachers, students are encouraged
to experiment with different art forms and refine their skills. They also
have the opportunity to showcase their talents in both national and international
art competitions, including the SYF Art Exhibition and the Kao International
Environment Painting Competition for Children.</p>
<p>Through these activities, students develop their artistic abilities while
gaining confidence and an appreciation for the arts. In addition to skill-building,
the CCA fosters creativity, critical thinking, and self-expression.</p>
