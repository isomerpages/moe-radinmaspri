<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Boys’ Brigade is an international movement with a presence in over
60 territories, founded by Sir William Alexander Smith in 1883. As part
of the Boys' Brigade, our members engage in activities that are fun, meaningful,
and challenging. The programme is designed to build essential life skills
such as discipline, self-respect, grooming, and teamwork, all within a
structured environment that includes uniforms, badges, and drills.</p>
<p>As members progress, they are given the opportunity to take on leadership
roles, where they guide and support junior members, serving as positive
role models and peer influences. Through their involvement in the Boys’
Brigade, students embark on an adventure that equips them with the skills
and character needed for the 21st Century.</p>
