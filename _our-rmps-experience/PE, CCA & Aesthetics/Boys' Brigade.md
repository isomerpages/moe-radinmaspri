<p>The Boys’ Brigade is an international movement with companies in more than 60 territories. Founded by Sir William Alexander Smith in 1883, the Boys’ Brigade is the pioneer of uniformed youth organisations and aims to be the organisation of choice for the youths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Boys’ Brigade is one of the longest-standing CCAs in Radin Mas Primary School. It continues to provide activities that are fun, meaningful and challenging. It seeks to build members in the habits of discipline, self-respect, grooming and teamwork. These are accomplished in the structure of uniform, badges and drills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the boys progressively show ability to lead and guide the junior members, they will be trained as leaders to assist teachers in managing younger boys through leading by example and being a positive peer influence. As members of The Boys’ Brigade, the boys will be embarking on an adventure that builds skills and character for the 21st Century.</p>
