<p><strong><u>Olympic Festival</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Olympic Festival is one of our schoolâ€™s signature events that empowers
our Primary 3-6 students to challenge themselves through friendly competitions
in 10 athletic events, emphasizing speed, agility, endurance, and power.
This event fosters a culture of excellence, teamwork, and sportsmanship,
while promoting class bonding through inter-class competitions. By participating,
students develop essential life skills, including communication, teamwork,
and resilience, while embracing the importance of regular exercise and
a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong><u>Mini Olympics </u></strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our Children's Day Celebrations, our Primary 1-2 students will
participate in the annual Lower Primary Sports Day, featuring inter-class
games designed to showcase their fundamental movement skills acquired through
P.E. lessons. This event encourages students to demonstrate their best
efforts, embody values of friendship, respect, and teamwork, and display
Olympic spirit and sportsmanship. With guidance from their P.E. teachers,
students will train hard to work together as a team, striving for excellence
and class pride, making this annual event a joyful and exciting experience.</p>
<p><strong><u>P4, 5 &amp; 6 Sports Education Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school offers Sports Education Programmes (SEP) for Primary 4-6 students,
promoting the value of sports education, encouraging participation, and
introducing alternative physical activities. Aligning with our objectives,
SEP aims to increase sporting opportunities and inspire an active, healthy
lifestyle among our students. Over the years, our P4-6 students have enjoyed
a range of SEP activities, including Tchoukball, Goalball, Kinball, and
Archery, which are organized annually to provide diverse and engaging experiences.</p>
