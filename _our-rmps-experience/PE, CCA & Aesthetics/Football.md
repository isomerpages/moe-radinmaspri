<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Football is an exciting and dynamic sport that offers our students the
opportunity to develop essential skills, values, and lasting memories.
At Radin Mas Primary School, the Football CCA consists of the junior, senior,
and recreational teams for boys from Primary 3 to Primary 6.</p>
<p>Through regular training sessions, our dedicated coaches and teachers-in-charge
focus on helping the boys improve their football skills while nurturing
character, teamwork, mental strength, and fitness. Parental support in
encouraging a healthy balance between schoolwork and play is also crucial
for the boys’ development.</p>
<p>Discipline, effort, and commitment are essential for our players to grow
into skilled athletes and well-rounded individuals. Training sessions require
focus and consistency, with players learning to push through challenges
both on and off the field. Football teaches perseverance, resilience, and
the importance of collaboration, as players learn to work together, communicate
effectively, and support one another.</p>
<p>By participating in Football CCA, our boys not only enjoy the sport they
love but also develop valuable life skills that will serve them well in
all aspects of their lives. We hope that through this experience, the boys
will make their mark, both on the field and in their personal growth</p>
