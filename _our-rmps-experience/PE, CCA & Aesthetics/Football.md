<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Football is one of the most popular sports in Singapore. At Radin Mas Primary School, the Football CCA is made up of the junior, senior and recreational teams consisting of Primary 3 to Primary 6 boys. On a regular basis, the coach and teachers-in-charge play their part in developing the boys&rsquo; character, teamwork, mental strength, fitness and skills though the training sessions. The support from parents to encourage their children to balance their time between schoolwork and play is also important. Through all these efforts, the boys would hopefully be able to 'make their mark&rsquo; in the sport or other areas of their lives.</p>
<p>Over the years, the teams have participated actively in various football tournaments. Some of the teams did exceptionally well. Among the notable achievements are getting a Top 4 place in the Interschool South Zone Tournament, winning the Interschool South Zone Tournament and achieving a Top 8 place in the Interschool National Tournament.</p>
<p>Friendly matches with other schools are also arranged for the boys to hone their fitness and skills, as well as to expose them to proper match play. In order for the boys to develop into good players, discipline, effort and commitment are required of them.</p>
