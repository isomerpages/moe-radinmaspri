<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Radin Mas Dragon Cub Scouts is a uniformed group CCA that helps to develop the physical, intellectual, emotional and social capacity of our students. We train our cub scouts to be well-versed in outdoor skills and place utmost importance in the inculcation of values.</p>
<p>Opportunities are given to our cub scouts to participate in outdoor activities for them to hone their skills through experiential learning. Camps, hikes, campfires, competitions and other activities ensure that they enjoy their time while learning.</p>
<p>The cub scouts have also been volunteering to support school events. By volunteering themselves to help others, we hope to help build a better world where they are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.</p>
