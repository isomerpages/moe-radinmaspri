<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Basketball is one of the exciting Sports CCAs offered at Radin Mas Primary
School. Through this fast-paced and competitive team sport, we aim to develop
the character of our members while instilling vital life lessons that will
benefit them beyond the court.</p>
<p>In our training sessions, members focus on developing both personal and
team basketball skills. The spirit of teamwork is encouraged, helping players
strengthen their physical and mental aspects of the game. Basketball offers
an opportunity for students to learn essential life skills with a positive
attitude, preparing them for the challenges they will face in life.</p>
<p>Through consistent training and participation in various competitions,
we hope our members will embrace the meaning of the school motto, "Work
Hard and Play Hard." They will learn that success comes only through endurance,
perseverance, hard work, and discipline.</p>
