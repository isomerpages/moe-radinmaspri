<p>Basketball is one of the Sports CCAs offered in Radin Mas Primary School. Through this fast-paced and competitive team sport, we hope to develop the character of our members and inculcate vital life lessons to them.</p>
<p>During training sessions, our members learn both personal and team basketball skills. Team spirit amongst members is also developed to strengthen their physical and mental aspects of the game. Basketball is a team sport that allows players to learn life skills with a positive attitude; an important process that students have to learn as they are bound to face challenges in their lives.</p>
<p>Through the training sessions and various competitions, we hope that our members will learn the meaning of the school motto "Work Hard and Play Hard" and realise that success can only be achieved through endurance, perseverance, hard work and discipline.</p>
