<p>Radin Mas Primary School Choir plays an active role both in school and in the community. The Choir performs during celebrations such as Chinese New Year concert, Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day celebration in school and in the heartlands.</p>
<p>To further engage the students, the Choir is highly involved in choir exchanges between schools and in other public performances. Aligned with the school&rsquo;s motto of &lsquo;Work Hard, Play Hard and Make a Mark&rsquo;, the Choir students attend annual choir camps and masterclasses during the holidays in order to further develop their potential and vocal skills.</p>
