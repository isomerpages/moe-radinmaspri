<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Radin Mas Primary School Choir plays an active role both within the school
and the wider community. Our choir performs at key school events such as
the Chinese New Year concert, Mid-Autumn Festival, and National Day celebrations,
as well as in community events in the heartlands.</p>
<p>To broaden students’ experiences, the choir regularly participates in
choir exchanges with other schools and performs at public events. Aligned
with the school’s motto, “Work Hard, Play Hard, Make a Mark,” our choir
members attend annual choir camps and masterclasses during the holidays
to further develop their vocal skills and unlock their full potential.</p>
<p>By being part of the Radin Mas Primary School Choir, students not only
improve their musical abilities but also gain confidence, discipline, and
a deep sense of teamwork.</p>
