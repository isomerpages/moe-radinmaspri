<p>English Language Drama and Debate Society (ELDDS) was set up in 2018. The goal of ELDDS is to cultivate and nurture a love and appreciation for drama and debate where students will acquire the necessary skills in effective communication and artistic expression to excel in drama, and/or debate. This also involves the skills for stage craft, the play production process and public speaking. Every member is given the opportunity to develop his/her talents and to excel confidently.</p>
<p>All members are trained and taught the core basics of dramatic technique – the use of levels to create effect, vocal projection, awareness of body language, facial expressions, and use of space. These members will then apply the techniques and perform in both competitive and non-competitive events. Selected members will participate in the annual storytelling (Story Alive!) and national public speaking (Plain English Speaking Awards – PESA) competitions. All members have the opportunity to conduct storytelling sessions in the school during K2 Visits and at Bukit Merah Public Library, as well as engage the elderly from Henderson Home through drama activities. Moreover, they will be invited to SOTA Showcases where they observe talented SOTA theatre students performing their crafts. In debate, all members go through training on how to formulate and present arguments in response to assigned motions. Selected members will go through further training (Junior LEXIS) by ACJC Debating and Oratorical Society and participate in the National Debate Competition (Wits and Words).</p>
