<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>English Language Drama and Debate Society (ELDDS) was set up in 2018.
The goal of ELDDS is to cultivate and nurture a love and appreciation for
drama and debate where students will acquire the necessary skills in effective
communication and artistic expression to excel in drama, and/or debate.
This also involves the skills for stagecraft, the play production process
and public speaking. Every member is given the opportunity to develop his/her
talents and to excel confidently.</p>
<p>All members are trained and taught the core basics of dramatic technique
â€“ the use of levels to create effect, vocal projection, awareness of body
language, facial expressions, and use of space. These members will then
apply the techniques and perform in both competitive and non-competitive
events. Selected members will participate in the annual International Science
Drama Competition and SYF competitions. All members have the opportunity
to participate during drama school performances such as STEAM Week and
PAM Week. Students will also have the opportunity to watch theatre performances
outside of school. In debate, all members go through training on how to
formulate and present arguments in response to assigned motions. Selected
members will go through further training and participate in the National
Debate Competition (Wits and Words).</p>
