<p><strong>P4 Art/NE/SS Museum-based Learning</strong></p>
<p>The P4 Art/NE/SS Museum-based Learning (MBL) experience is designed to provide the breadth and depth of learning local art as part of all Primary 4 students’ core learning experience in the art curriculum.</p>
<p>The museum, being a custodian of culture &amp; heritage, presents an authentic context for the learning of local art as part of students’ understanding of Singapore’s heritage. The whole learning experience comprises a pre-visit lesson in class, the actual learning journey to the National Gallery of Singapore followed by a post-visit lesson in school where students get to express and showcase their art experience.</p>
<p>The visit to the museum also presents our students with the opportunity to learn about what an art museum is, the history of its architecture, the museum etiquette and the roles of the various personnel taking care of the museum. Students also get to demonstrate appropriate interpersonal skills to build positive relationships with their classmates and teachers.</p>
