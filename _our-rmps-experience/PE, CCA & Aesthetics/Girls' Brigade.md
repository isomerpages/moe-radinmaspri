<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Girls’ Brigade aims to develop each girl to her fullest potential by equipping,
empowering and enabling Every Girl to Be a Leader.</p>
<p>Through our programmes, we develop character, provide opportunities for
the girls to develop their leadership qualities and serve the communities
so that they can blossom into Servant Leaders.</p>
<p>The girls interact with one another, tap on each other’s strength to work
together as a team during the various National events; Junior Leadership
Training Camp, Fast Food &amp; Fast Camp, National Drill Competition and
Low Guat Tin Challenge. They also improve their social skills and make
a difference in the lives of others through participation in the GB Friend
in Deed.</p>
