<p>Rugby is the latest CCA introduced in Radin Mas Primary School in 2019 to build character and resilience in our members. Historically, this fast-paced and physical team game, is believed to instil the gentlemanly values of unselfishness, fearlessness, teamwork and self-control of the players. Thus, our CCA aims to equip our members with these values that can guide them in all aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>Members will be put through an age-appropriate program that is structured to ensure each player develops the basic skills to be able to safely participate in and enjoy the game of rugby. Besides progressively learning fundamental individual ball skills, to playing as a team in skill-appropriate games, the boys can look forward to getting stronger, faster and more agile, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>In time, we aim to build a team to do Radin Mas Primary School proud and make a mark in Inter-School Rugby matches and competitions.</p>
