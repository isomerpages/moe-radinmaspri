<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Rugby was introduced as a CCA in Radin Mas Primary School in 2019 to build
character, resilience, and teamwork among our members. This fast-paced
and physical sport is traditionally associated with values such as unselfishness,
fearlessness, discipline, and self-control—principles we aim to instill
in our players both on and off the field.</p>
<p>Our structured, age-appropriate programme ensures that each player develops
fundamental skills to participate in and enjoy the game safely. Members
will progressively learn individual ball-handling techniques, teamwork
strategies, and game-play fundamentals. Through training, they will grow
stronger, faster, and more agile—both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we aspire to build a competitive team that will represent
Radin Mas Primary School with pride and make a mark in the National School
Games and other rugby competitions.</p>
