<p>Radin Mas Primary School has been on a Positive Education journey from 2018 onwards. Guided by the work of Martin Seligman in his book Flourish, the school aims to bring our students and staff to the state of flourish. This is the state where our staff and students are able to find fulfillment in their lives, to accomplish meaningful and worthwhile tasks, to connect with others at a deeper level or in short to live &ldquo;the good life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We believe that Positive Education would be a useful tool to allow our students to build greater confidence in themselves and to be able to face the challenges of the future with graciousness, optimism and resilience.</p>
<p>Basing our approaches on Seligman&rsquo;s five key elements of <strong>P</strong>ositive Emotions,&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>ngagement,&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>elationship,&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>eaning and&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>chievement or&nbsp;<strong><em>PERMA</em></strong>, the school has designed a variety of experiences to guide our students through each element.</p>
