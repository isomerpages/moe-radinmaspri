<p>Students embark on a 6-years progressive Computational Thinking and Design Thinking Curriculum where they will be exposed to a variety of real-world problems/ scenarios and transform those challenges into opportunities for design. The Primary 4 to 6 students learn Computational Thinking (CT) through Scratch and Micro:bits coding as part of the school-based curriculum. In order to cultivate their computational thinking approach in their learning and development, Design Week Challenges are carried out during recesses to encourage students to apply their analytical thinking in designing products through play.</p>
