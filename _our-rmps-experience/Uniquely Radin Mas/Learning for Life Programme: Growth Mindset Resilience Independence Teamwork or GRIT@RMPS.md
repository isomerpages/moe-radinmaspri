<p><strong>P3 Outdoor Escapade Camp&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The P3 Camp is a one-day outdoor adventure held at a nearby location,
such as Telok Blangah Hill, Labrador Park, or Sentosa. The camp aims to
cultivate a sense of place and community among students by exploring the
local flora, fauna, and history. Additionally, the camp serves as a precursor
to the P5 overnight camp, equipping students with essential outdoor skills
such as packing, basic first aid, navigation and map-reading skills. Through
interactive activities, students will develop self-reliance, learn to manage
their needs, and provide basic care for others. The camp also fosters positive
relationships among classmates and teachers, promoting teamwork, communication,
and mutual support.</p>

<p><strong>P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>The P5 camp at MOE's Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre (OALC) features
challenging obstacle courses that cater to students' physical and mental
abilities. These obstacles help students overcome fears and experience
success through completing challenges. Highlights include the high tower
challenge circuit, rock wall climbing, abseiling, and a hike. Other activities,
such as low elements, tent pitching, night walk, and campfire, promote
effective communication, responsible decision-making, and teamwork. Through
individual and collective decision-making, students are empowered to participate
in activities and overcome obstacles, fostering self-confidence and resilience.</p>
