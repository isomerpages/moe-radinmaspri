<p>Dear Radin Mas family,</p>
<p>In the past year, there were many ups and downs but I always remembered to stay positive. My journey as a student leader was not as smooth sailing as I thought it would be. When I first started out, I thought that I was expected to be perfect in everything. At some point, I questioned myself but then I realized that perfection is unattainable. However, excellence is achievable with concerted effort.</p>
<p>Let me give some examples. I might not be the smartest student and I make mistakes every now and then. Sometimes the pressure of being a student leader would get to me. However, I remind myself not to confuse &lsquo;excellence&rsquo; with &lsquo;perfection&rsquo;. As a student leader, I uphold our school values. The school value that I always remind myself to follow is &lsquo;Never Giving Up&rsquo; &ndash; <strong>strive to be the best I can be and do the best I can do.</strong></p>
<p>Service is an important aspect in my life. As a student leader I pride myself to always put others before myself. I believe that people matter and helping others will help me grow as an individual. For example, during the P5 camp, my friends needed a helping hand to carry some of their heavy items. Although I had my own things to carry, I never liked to leave my friends behind and together we persevered.</p>
<p>No man is an island, and we must work as a team. During my Future Problem Solving Program sessions, I learnt the importance of teamwork and was able to apply it as a student leader by encouraging other fellow prefects to work together with me. One high point was when we hosted the Teachers&rsquo; Day concert. With the help of a few teachers, the prefects managed to organise a live concert after two years. It was one of my favourite moments in school and I was happy to be able to bring joy to the school. I am grateful for the opportunity.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2023, I hope that the Covid-19 restrictions will ease so that my schoolmates will be able to experience more and have more opportunities to learn and grow. I look forward to more learning journeys, group activities, field trips and even overseas camps. I also hope that the school will continue to be a safe and inclusive environment where everyone can do what they love and live their dreams.</p>
<p>I would like to also thank my family, teachers and friends for their help, love and support. They really helped me through this year. I hope everyone can model the school values so, let&rsquo;s Work Hard, Play Hard, and Make A Mark to make our school a better place.</p>
